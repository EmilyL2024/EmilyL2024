### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome! My name is Emily, and I'm an undergraduate student at Wake Forest University double majoring in Statistics and Computer Science. This page displays some of the projects I've done. The most used languages in my projects are R and java, and I'm most comfortable using R for data analysis and model building.
