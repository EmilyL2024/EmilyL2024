## Project Description:

This is a Java program that processes a file containing a list of possible FQDNs (Fully Qualified Domain Name) to report on the number of unique FQDNs, 2LD (2nd Level Domain), and TLDs (Top-Level Domain) found in the file.
To ensure the efficiency of the program, doubly linked-lists and sorted linked-lists are used for processing, and bouth of them implement the generic List interface that extends the Java Iterable interface.
Both of the doubly linked-lists and sorted linked-lists relies on Java API LinkedList to store data. The only difference is that doubly linked-lists add items in the order they appear in the file, while sorted linked-lists add items in the sorted order.

## File Description:
DList: doubly linked-lists implementation
SortedList: sorted linked-lists implementation
